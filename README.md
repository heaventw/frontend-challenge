## Details
* I used **React, Redux, Saga, SCSS, React-Intl**. I added tests for complex components and sagas.<br />
* I spent quite some time on the **visual side** ðŸŽ¨:<br />
  ** Responsive design<br />
  ** CSS Animations and transitions<br />
  ** Attention to details:<br />
    *** Spinners for fetching the list of expenses, posting comments or uploading files. <br />
    *** Notifications for connectivity issues with proper `alertdialog` ARIA role.<br />
* **I put a lot of effort into semantic and accessibility**. For example, I implemented Cards pattern for expenses (see [implementation](https://github.com/vstanyshevskyy/expenses-app/blob/master/frontend/src/helpers/card-click-helper.js) inspired by [Heydon Pickering](https://inclusive-components.design/cards/)) which I'm proud about. The list of expenses is actually `<ul>` with nested lists which should be great for SEO and accessibility as well.<br />
* App has 97-100 scores in Google Lighthouse.<br />
* The trickiest parts were i18n (I haven't used react-intl before, so took some time to get up to speed) and responsive design.<br />
* It took me about **22 hours** to implement it according to git logs. I dedicated some spare time for it and had a couple of design changes that slowed me down (yes, I tried to build something similar to Pleo app, but there are not many screenshots on the internet.)

## What I would like to add
* Filtering by currency
* Some gallery/modal for receipt + ability to delete a receipt.
* Drag and drop for receipts upload
* [Web Sharing API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/share) to share expenses

## API changes
* I did some API changes to deploy API to Heroku (moved TS dependencies from dev-deps to deps)
* Allowed to send an empty comment to delete it. [Commit](https://github.com/vstanyshevskyy/expenses-app/commit/aca61616d5c60c7717f5554cf0189e74c25aaea1)
